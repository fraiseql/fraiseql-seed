# Seed Common Baseline (Format 2: Explicit Data)
#
# Define exact seed data with specific values for deterministic testing.
# This format is useful when you need precise control over baseline data.

# Notes:
# - FK values (fk_organization: 1) reference instance numbers, not pk_* values
# - Instance numbers are derived from list position (1-based index)
# - Trinity columns (id, identifier) can be specified explicitly
# - pk_* columns are auto-generated by database
#
# Usage:
#   builder = SeedBuilder(conn, schema="public", seed_common="db/seed_common.yaml")
#   # Seed common data is validated for FK consistency on load
