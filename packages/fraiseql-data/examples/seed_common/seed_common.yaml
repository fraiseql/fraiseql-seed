# Seed Common Baseline (Format 1: Instance Counts)
#
# This defines the required baseline layer that all test data builds upon.
# Seed common eliminates UUID collisions and provides clear separation between:
# - Instances 1-1,000: Seed common (reserved baseline)
# - Instances 1,001-999,999: Test data (test-specific)
# - Instances 1,000,000+: Generated data (runtime)

baseline:
  # Core entities (minimal baseline for testing)
  tb_organization: 5      # 5 organizations in baseline
  tb_location: 3          # 3 locations
  tb_machine: 10          # 10 machines
  tb_contract: 2          # 2 contracts

  # Reference data (static lookup tables)
  tb_status: 5            # Status codes (active, pending, etc.)
  tb_category: 8          # Product/service categories

# Usage:
#   builder = SeedBuilder(conn, schema="public", seed_common="db/seed_common.yaml")
#   seeds = builder.add("tb_allocation", count=100, auto_deps=True).execute()
#
#   Auto-deps will use seed common instances instead of generating new ones.
#   Test data starts at instance 1,001 (after seed common range).
