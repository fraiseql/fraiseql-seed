# Seed Common Baseline - Staging Environment
#
# Environment-specific seed common for staging/QA environment.
# Loaded when FRAISEQL_ENV=staging or ENV=staging
#
# Minimal baseline for staging - production-like but lightweight.

baseline:
  # Core entities (production-like minimal set)
  tb_organization: 3      # Representative orgs only
  tb_location: 2          # Main + backup location
  tb_machine: 5           # Small machine inventory
  tb_contract: 2          # Standard contract types

  # Users (staging accounts)
  tb_user: 5              # QA team accounts
  tb_role: 5              # Core roles only

  # Reference data (minimal)
  tb_status: 5            # Essential statuses only
  tb_category: 5          # Main categories
  tb_product_type: 3      # Core product types

# Staging philosophy:
# - Minimal baseline to reduce test execution time
# - Production-like structure but smaller scale
# - Stable data for CI/CD pipelines
#
# Usage:
#   export ENV=staging
#   builder = SeedBuilder(conn, schema="public", seed_common="db/")
#   # Auto-loads seed_common.staging.yaml
