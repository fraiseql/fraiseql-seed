# Phase 4 Plan Summary - 2026-01-01

## Phase 4 Plan Created! 📋

Comprehensive Phase 4 plan written at `/home/lionel/.claude/plans/phase4-fraiseql-data.md`

### Proposed Features:

**1. Data Import (JSON/CSV)**
- Import seed data from JSON/CSV files (reverse of Phase 3 export)
- `Seeds.from_json()`, `Seeds.from_csv()` class methods
- `builder.insert_seeds()` to load fixtures into database
- **Use case**: Fast test fixtures, debugging workflows

**2. Staging Backend (In-Memory)**
- Test seed generation without database connection
- `SeedBuilder(conn=None, backend="staging")`
- Simulates pk_* generation, UNIQUE validation
- **Use case**: Fast unit tests, offline development, prototyping

**3. Advanced Constraint Satisfaction**
- Auto-satisfy simple CHECK constraints via parsing
- Supports: `IN ('a','b')`, `BETWEEN x AND y`, `> value`, etc.
- Falls back to warning for complex constraints
- **Use case**: Reduce boilerplate for common constraints

**4. Batch Operations API**
- Fluent API with context manager: `with builder.batch() as b:`
- Conditional operations: `batch.when(condition).add(...)`
- Dynamic counts: `count=lambda: random.randint(50, 150)`
- **Use case**: Complex multi-table workflows, reusable patterns

### Plan Structure:
- Full TDD workflow (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → QA)
- 12 new tests (3 per feature)
- Detailed implementation with code examples
- ~16-21 hours estimated effort
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Key Questions for Evaluation:

1. **Do these features align with your needs?**
   - Which features are most valuable?
   - Are any unnecessary or lower priority?

2. **Any missing features?**
   - What problems are you trying to solve that aren't covered?
   - Any other pain points in the current workflow?

3. **Priority order?**
   - Should we implement all 4, or focus on specific ones?
   - Is there a different feature set you'd prefer?

### Current Status:

- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Core foundation, Trinity pattern, realistic data)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (Self-references, UNIQUE constraints, bulk inserts)
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Complete (Data export, generator plugins, multi-column UNIQUE, CHECK constraints)
- **Phase 4**: 📋 Plan written, awaiting evaluation

### Next Steps:

1. Review Phase 4 plan against real needs
2. Adjust feature set based on priorities
3. Proceed with Phase 4-RED (write failing tests)
4. Implement selected features
